<h1>Tetanus</h1>
<h3>A high speed webscraper for Pastebin written in Rust</h3>
<p>
This is a thin client for webscraping Pastebin.
There are no headless browsers or anything past sending GET requests to get raw data and dumping it.
Tetanus also supports proxies through the enviromnental variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY on UNIX-like systems.
